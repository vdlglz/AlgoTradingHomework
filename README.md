#Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

##Step:1 What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
##Increasing the window to 6 months increased the return performance.


##Step:2 What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?
##Changing the small window to 3 days showed a small improvement in the returns.

##Step: 3 The best performing model was the tuned model with the original SMA windows and time offset of 6 months.

#Backtest the new model to evaluate its performance

##Step: 3 Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm? 
##The tuned model performed consistently better than the baseline. The updated model overall was also better than the baseline but fell off in 2018 and 2021.
